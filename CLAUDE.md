# HQP Global — Project Knowledge Base

## CRITICAL: HQP vs. CRIS GOLD™ AI — Two Separate Products

These are **two independent products**. NEVER conflate them. The team, ownership, and founders are different.

---

### HeartQuest Professional™ (HQP)
- **What it is:** A clinical HRV hardware assessment device (the physical sensor + measurement software)
- **Founding Team (all 6 people):**
  - Dr. Michael Kessler (D.C., C.C.S.P.) — Co-Founder & Clinical Director
  - Dr. Sondra Becchetti (D.C., F.I.A.C.A.) — Co-Founder
  - Dr. Javdat Karimov (NMD) — Co-Founder & Parameter Architect
  - Ruan De Necker — Co-Founder & CTO
  - Gabriel Theron — Co-Founder & Global Marketing
  - Stephen Emond — Canadian & International Distributor
- **About page:** `about.html` — this is the HQP team page

---

### CRIS GOLD™ AI
- **What it is:** An AI-powered clinical reporting software that runs on top of the HQP device
- **Creator: Dr. Michael Kessler ONLY** — sole creator, independently created
- **The other HQP team members (Becchetti, Karimov, De Necker, Theron, Emond) are NOT founders, co-founders, or co-owners of CRIS GOLD™ AI**
- CRIS GOLD™ AI is Dr. Kessler's independent product — do not list the HQP team as its team

---

## Product Hierarchy
1. **HQP** (HeartQuest Professional) — the foundational hardware product, buy this first
2. **CRIS GOLD™ AI** — AI software add-on created by Dr. Kessler that runs on HQP

Customers must own HQP to use CRIS GOLD™ AI.

## Branding Rules
- The HQP team page (`about.html`) = HeartQuest Professional team only
- CRIS GOLD™ AI pages = Dr. Michael Kessler as sole creator; do NOT list the full HQP team
- Never say "the team behind CRIS GOLD™" when referring to the 6-person HQP team
- CRIS GOLD™ AI attributions: "Created by Dr. Michael Kessler"
- HQP attributions: "Built by Dr. Kessler, Dr. Becchetti, Dr. Karimov, Ruan De Necker, Gabriel Theron, and Stephen Emond"
