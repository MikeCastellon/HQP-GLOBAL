      <h3>Our Origin Story</h3>
      <p>In 2010, Dr. Kessler, Dr. Becchetti, and Dr. Karimov were the first to bring sophisticated Functional Evaluation Technology — including Heart Rate Variability — from Russia to the United States. They spent years translating the research, developing manuals, and teaching the technology to clinicians across North America.</p>
      <p>After teaching this technology for over 10 years, the team made the decision to break away from the Russian platform and develop an entirely new, improved system — one built from the ground up with their own clinical wisdom, a global team of experts, and modern software architecture. The result is CRIS GOLD™ — the most advanced clinical HRV and Eastern medicine assessment platform available today.</p>
      <p>Your health depends on how robustly and dynamically your Autonomic Nervous System can adapt to change in the environment. CRIS GOLD™ was built to measure exactly that.</p>
